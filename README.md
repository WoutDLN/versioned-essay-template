# re:write
A light-weight template for generating a web-hosted essay from a markdown file through a versioned writing process. 

## About

This template was designed to help students write a critical essay in markdown, with automatic reference formatting via a linked `.bib` file, while keeping track of their writing process through git's versioning system. The template uses a built-in workflow for visualising and publishing the essay with GitHub Pages, and/or developing the essay locally with pandoc. 

The template was developed by [Wout Dillen](https://www.hb.se/forskning/forskningsportal/forskare/wout-dillen/), Senior Lecturer in Library and Information Science at the [University of Borås](https://www.hb.se/en/).

## Technical requirements

To publish the essay with GitHub Pages, you only need a GitHub account, and to activate the deployment through `Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source > Github Actions`. 

To develop the essay locally to check changes before committing, install pandoc (if you haven't already) by following [the relevant instructions for your OS](https://pandoc.org/installing.html). Afterwards, HTML files can be generated from the markdown by navigating to the relevant directory in a terminal, and running:
```
make preview
```
